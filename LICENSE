Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.
 
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.
 
  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.
 
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.
In anticipating for your urgent cooperation

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.
 
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.
 
  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.
 
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.
 
In anticipating for your urgent cooperation
 
Thank you, God Bless America.

	Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																									
	 																																									
	  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																									
	 																																									
	  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																									
	 																																									
	NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																										
 																																										
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up.

		Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																								
		 																																								
		  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																								
		 																																								
		  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																								
		 																																								
		NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																								
		 																																								
		In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																								
		 																																								
		Thank you, God Bless America.

		Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																								
		Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																								
		for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																								
		payment due to insufficient funds.																																								
		Total charges for 1 items $36																																								
		The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																								
		Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																								
		NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																								
		of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																								
		Here’s what you need to																																								
		do immediately:																																								
		Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																								
		and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																								
		account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																								
		been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																								
		way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																								
		branch.																																								
		It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																								
		#barcode																																								
		Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																								
		the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																								
		subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																								
		overdrawn.																																								
		Here are your current																																								
		account settings:																																								
		Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																								
		up this service.																																								
		Overdraft Coverage: Your account is currently Opted In. You or your joint owner may revoke your																																								
		opt-in or opt-out choice at any time. To learn more about PNC Overdraft Solutions, visit us online at																																								
		pnc.com/overdraftsolutions. To manage both your Overdraft Coverage and Overdraft Protection																																								
		settings, call 1-877-588-3605, visit any branch, or sign on to PNC Online Banking, and select the																																								
		Overdraft Solutions link under the Account Services section.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
Create Pull Request action will:
1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
   - untracked (new) files
   - tracked (modified) files
   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.
## Documentation
- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)
- [Examples](docs/examples.md)
- [Updating to v3](docs/updating.md)
## Usage
```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Make changes to pull request here
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```
You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v3.x.x`
### Action inputs
All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

### Action outputs
The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs.
Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
```
### Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.
Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.
Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.
How the action behaves:
- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.
- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
- If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).
#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.
This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.
- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`
- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`
- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`
### Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.
Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).
```yml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```
### Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
### Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Create or Update Project Card
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
        with:
          project-name: My project
          column-name: My column
          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
```
## Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.
Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.
```yml
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Make changes to pull request
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          commit-message: Update report
          committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com>
          author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
          signoff: false
          branch: example-patches
          delete-branch: true
          title: '[Example] Update report'
          body: |
            Update report
            - Updated with *today's* date
            - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1]
            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request
          labels: |
            report
            automated pr
          assignees: peter-evans
          reviewers: peter-evans
          team-reviewers: |
            owners
            maintainers
          milestone: 1
          draft: false
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
```
An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:

Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:
jobs: my_job: name: deploy to staging runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:
ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."
Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.
To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.
- name: Setup Node uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: '10.x
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.
- name: Install Dependencies run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.
For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run cross 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:
jobs: test: name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy: matrix: node_version: ['8', '10', '12'] os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }} uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }} - name: npm install, build and test run: | npm install npm run build --if-present npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context
For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:
steps: - run: 
NPC :AUTOMATE :publish.yml :
 if :true.:continue-on-false :
 github.event_name == 'Pushs/Response.md '

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Click OK.
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

Installing the Sun Java JDK
When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
To install the Sun Java SDK:
Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
On the welcome page, click Next.
On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
Click the Change button.
In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
Click OK.
On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
The installation process begins.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
